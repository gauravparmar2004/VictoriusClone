            <h1>Why Work With an Ecommerce SEO Company?</h1>
            <p>Data from the <span> Ecommerce Foundation’s United States Ecommerce Country Report </span>indicates that
                88% of
                customers start their buying journey with search engines. <br> <br> These buyers want to make an
                informed decision and are looking for reviews, comparisons, and other information that can help them
                purchase from online stores with confidence.
                <br> <br>
                While paid search and display ads will bring some traffic to your website, ad blockers and ad blindness
                reduce the ROI of your advertising spend. And the minute you stop paying for ads, they stop driving
                traffic.
                <br> <br>
                On the other hand, while a search engine optimization campaign requires an upfront investment, its
                effectiveness compounds over time and <span> brings in better converting customers.</span>
                <br> <br>
                If your ecommerce website doesn’t appear in search engine results when buyers search for product
                information, you’ll lose customers to other ecommerce websites that have invested in optimizing their
                category pages for search engines.

                <h5>Google Analytics Ecommerce Tracking</h5>
                <p>For ecommerce businesses whose point of sale sits directly on their website, the Google Analytics
                    (GA) ecommerce tracking feature provides a comprehensive overview of data like average order value,
                    number of orders, and billing location. <br> <br>

                    With GA ecommerce tracking set up correctly, we can correlate sales data with your organic traffic
                    channel. <br> <br>

                    From there, determining the ROI of our ecommerce SEO services becomes a simple calculation of
                    dollars invested and increased revenue attributed to organic traffic.

                    Our customized reporting dashboard provides clear insights that are easily translatable to

                <h5>Google Analytics Goal Tracking</h5>
                <p>While revenue generation is a compelling metric to track, other types of conversions might serve as
                    leading indicators for future sales.
                    <br> <br>
                    Our ecommerce SEO agency can set up Google Analytics to track important events on your website, such
                    as email sign-ups, wishlist additions, or social media shares.
                    <br><br>
                    By monitoring metrics upstream of sales, you can connect organic traffic increases to top-of-funnel
                    opportunities to nurture new customers.
                    <br><br>
                    This kind of tracking demonstrates the value of SEO to future-proof your revenue generation.

                <h5>Sustainable Revenue</h5>
                <p>An ecommerce SEO consultant should drive traffic directly from search to purchase by targeting your
                    most lucrative conversion points. <br> <br>

                    If you encounter an ecommerce SEO agency that can’t draw a straight line from the budget you invest
                    to the revenue generated, look for another ecommerce SEO service provider. <br> <br>

                    Our monthly reports focus on revenue generation and the ROI of your SEO campaign to celebrate
                    notable wins. The hidden bonus of tracking revenue? Those reports reveal even more opportunities for
                    growth.</p> <br> <br>
                <h5>Long-Term Gains From Ecommerce SEO Services</h5>
                <p>Initial efforts in your campaign will focus on technical SEO and extensive keyword research to inform
                    high-impact activities that generate immediate traction for your ecommerce brand. <br><br>

                    As your campaign progresses, that same keyword research will propel additional on-page SEO and
                    off-site SEO activities — like content creation and link-building — to build topical authority. For
                    an ecommerce brand that wants to future-proof revenue generation, topical authority is the gift that
                    keeps giving — creating gains that compound over time.
                    <br> <br>
                    While ecommerce SEO services cost more upfront than paid advertising, your business will continue to
                    benefit from search engine optimization long-term.

                    As your campaign progresses, that same keyword research will propel additional on-page SEO and
                    off-site SEO activities — like content creation and link-building — to build topical authority. For
                    an ecommerce brand that wants to future-proof revenue generation, topical authority is the gift that
                    keeps giving — creating gains that compound over time.
                    <br> <br>
                    While ecommerce SEO services cost more upfront than paid advertising, your business will continue to
                    benefit from search engine optimization long-term.
